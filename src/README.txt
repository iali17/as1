This program keeps track of your fuel logs. When you first start the app you have are displayed with all your previous
logs. The total cost is displayed at the bottom. Now you have 3 options. You can either 
1. Exit the App = Click the home button
2. Edit an Entry = Click on the entry you want to edit
3. Add new Entry = Click on the Add button.

When editing/adding an entry you are limited in what you can enter into the fields (eg. you cannot enter numbers on 
the odemeter text box). When you are done editing/adding a new entry click done and it will bring you back into the main
interface. If you click cancel it will neither change or add the entry.
